/**
 * EXPRESS SERVER SETUP WITH WEBSOCKET INTEGRATION
 *
 * This file handles the complete setup and configuration of the Express.js server
 * for the DevOps Insights Dashboard backend, enhanced with WebSocket capabilities
 * for real-time communication. Express serves as a minimal HTTP server framework
 * handling only essential endpoints, while WebSockets handle all main application communication.
 *
 * Key Responsibilities:
 * - Create and configure the Express application instance for minimal HTTP endpoints
 * - Set up security middleware (helmet, CORS, rate limiting) for HTTP requests
 * - Configure body parsing middleware for essential HTTP endpoints only
 * - Set up request logging and monitoring middleware for HTTP traffic
 * - Configure health check, metrics, and status HTTP endpoints (non-main application data)
 * - Set up error handling middleware for HTTP requests
 * - Configure compression and performance optimizations for HTTP responses
 * - Integrate WebSocket server with the Express HTTP server
 * - Set up WebSocket connection handling for main application (no authentication)
 * - Configure WebSocket message routing and real-time data streaming for all dashboard data
 * - Implement hybrid architecture where Express handles minimal system endpoints
 *   and WebSockets handle all main DevOps dashboard communication
 *
 * This setup creates a minimal Express server for essential system endpoints
 * with WebSockets handling all primary dashboard communication and real-time data exchange.
 * Express endpoints are limited to health checks, metrics, and basic system status only.

// TODO: Implement Express server with WebSocket integration
// - Create minimal Express app instance for system endpoints only
// - Configure HTTP routes for health checks, metrics, and status (no main app data)
// - Set up WebSocket server attached to Express HTTP server for main communication
// - Configure WebSocket message handlers for all dashboard data and user interactions
// - Export configured Express app (minimal) and WebSocket server (primary)
