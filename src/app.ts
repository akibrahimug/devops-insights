/**
 * MAIN APPLICATION ENTRY POINT
 *
 * This is the primary entry point for the DevOps Insights Dashboard backend application.
 * It coordinates the initialization of all major application components including the
 * Express server (for minimal system endpoints) with integrated WebSocket capabilities
 * (for all main application communication), database connections, and both minimal HTTP
 * routes and comprehensive real-time communication handlers.
 *
 * Key Responsibilities:
 * - Initialize Express application for minimal HTTP endpoints (health, metrics, status only)
 * - Initialize WebSocket server for all main dashboard communication and data exchange
 * - Set up minimal HTTP middleware for system endpoints only
 * - Establish database connections (MongoDB and Redis)
 * - Register minimal HTTP API routes (health checks, metrics, system status only)
 * - Configure comprehensive WebSocket handlers for all dashboard functionality
 * - Start the Express server with WebSocket capabilities
 * - Handle graceful shutdown procedures for both HTTP and WebSocket connections
 * - Configure environment-specific settings
 *
 * Architecture Note: Express handles ONLY minimal system requests (health checks, metrics,
 * basic status) while WebSockets handle ALL main application communication including
 * dashboard data, user interactions, and real-time updates. No authentication is
 * implemented to maintain simplicity and focus on core DevOps functionality.
 *
 * This file serves as the orchestrator that brings together all the individual
 * components (minimal Express setup, database setup, system HTTP routes, comprehensive
 * WebSocket handlers) to create a backend service where WebSockets are the primary
 * communication method and Express provides essential system monitoring endpoints.
