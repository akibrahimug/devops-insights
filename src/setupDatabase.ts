/**
 * DATABASE CONNECTION SETUP AND CONFIGURATION
 *
 * This file manages the initialization and configuration of all database connections
 * for the DevOps Insights Dashboard backend. It handles both MongoDB (primary database)
 * and Redis (caching layer) connections with proper error handling and monitoring.
 *
 * Key Responsibilities:
 * - Establish MongoDB connection using Mongoose or native driver
 * - Configure MongoDB connection options (pooling, timeouts, retry logic)
 * - Initialize Redis connection for caching and session storage
 * - Set up database event listeners for connection monitoring
 * - Handle database connection errors and reconnection logic
 * - Configure database logging and health monitoring
 * - Set up graceful database disconnect procedures
 * - Initialize database indexes and collections if needed
 *
 * This setup ensures robust database connectivity with proper error handling,
 * monitoring, and recovery mechanisms for both primary and cache databases.
